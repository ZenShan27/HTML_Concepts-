# üìò Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create content for the World Wide Web. It provides the basic structure for web pages, allowing web browsers to interpret and render text, images, links, videos, and other multimedia elements. As a markup language, HTML doesn't involve logic or computation, but rather focuses on organizing and formatting content.

The term "HyperText" refers to text that contains links to other texts. It allows users to navigate seamlessly between different web pages or sections within a document. "Markup Language" indicates the use of predefined elements or tags that label pieces of content, so browsers understand how to display them.

HTML is incredibly beginner-friendly, making it an excellent starting point for aspiring web developers. It uses a set of straightforward tags that wrap content to describe its role or appearance in the structure of a page.

## üåê The Role of HTML in the Web Ecosystem

HTML acts as the skeleton of every web page. While CSS defines the design and layout, and JavaScript handles interactivity, HTML gives content its semantic structure and meaning. Each element has a specific role‚Äîlike headers, paragraphs, images, links, sections, and forms‚Äîthat help define the layout and purpose of the content.

Modern HTML encourages best practices such as semantic coding, accessibility enhancements, and mobile-first design principles. HTML5 introduced a host of new elements and APIs that support multimedia integration, form validations, local storage, geolocation, and offline web app capabilities.
